# Simple Linear Regression — Self Made

-> This project demonstrates the **manual implementation of Simple Linear Regression** without using sklearn.  
-> It focuses on deriving the regression equation mathematically, implementing it in Python, and visualizing the fitted line.


## Objective:-

-> To implement Simple Linear Regression from scratch and understand how the slope and intercept are computed mathematically.


## Libraries Used:-

-> numpy 
-> pandas
-> matplotlib
